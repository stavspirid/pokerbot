    Attributes
    ----------
    _coordinator_id : str
        Unique game coordinator identifier (token), duplicate from ClientGameState._coordinator_id
    _round_id : int
        Round counter, starts from 1
    _card : str, in ['J', 'Q', 'K', '?']
        Current card in hand; '?' means the exact card rank is unknown and has to be recognized from _card_image
    _card_image : Image
        Current card image in hand
    _turn_order : int, in [ 1, 2 ]
        Player turn position for the current round, player '1' acts first
    _moves_history : list of str
        Previously made actions of both players. Actions in the list alternate between players, i.e., the first element
        is the first action of player '1', and the second element is the first action of player '2', etc. The last
        element of _moves_history is the last action made by your opponent. If you're the first to move, _moves_history
        will be empty.
    _available_actions : list of str, where str in subset of ['BET', 'CHECK', 'FOLD', 'CALL']
        Available actions this turn, e.g., on the first move, _available_actions = ['BET', 'CHECK', 'FOLD'].
    _outcome : str
        Amount of chips won this round. Negative values indicate a loss.
    _cards : str
        Cards at showdown for both players, concatenated in player order. I.e., 'KJ' indicates player '1' holds a 'K',
        and player '2' holds a 'J'. If the opposing player folds, a question-mark is returned for that player's card;
        i.e. 'K?' indicates the card for player '2' was not revealed at showdown.
